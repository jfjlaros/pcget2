pcget2

This version should work exactly like the original pcget, except it can write
directly to floppy by giving the command option -w.

pcget2 -w

The program will now ask to change disk (I recommend running this binary
from disk because it uses a lot of memory), and it will format the disk, 
filling it with the data provided by amigaput writing 20 tracks at a time. 
WARNING: It destroys all data on the disk!

Use amigaput2 to send data, it is more patient if the receiver stops to write
the tracks to disk.

If pcget2 does not work for some reason, you could try to use the pcget_debug 
binary, which writes 5 tracks at a time and will verify the written tracks. 
I made it do find out why the disks I made did not work, it was a virus!

BUGS:
pcget2 Always says that the filesize is 0 when the -w option is given.
pcget2 will write everything to disk when the -w option is given, no additional
checking for filesize or headers is done.
